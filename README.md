# Algorithm-Design

This class was taken as an independent study using Kleinberg and Tardos [textbook](https://github.com/cayton10/Algorithm-Design/blob/main/Book/Algorithm%20Design%20by%20Jon%20Kleinberg%2C%20Eva%20Tardos.pdf) of the same name. 

# Project Builds

These projects were built using VSCode for MacOS. To build and run these projects in VSCode, you must do so from each project directory. For instance, if you want to run main.cpp for testing the undirected graph cycles, open Ch_3_Graphs directory as a project, build the project, and run it. If you attempt to run projects from the Algorithms root directory, the paths to the executables and data files will not work correctly.
